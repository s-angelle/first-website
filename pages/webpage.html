          "Off-the-grid or off-grid is a characteristic of buildings and a
          lifestyle[1] designed in an independent manner without reliance on one
          or more public utilities. The term "off-the-grid" traditionally refers
          to not being connected to the electrical grid, but can also include
          other utilities like water, gas, and sewer systems, and can scale from
          residential homes to small communities. Off-the-grid living allows for
          buildings and people to be self-sufficient, which is advantageous in
          isolated locations where normal utilities cannot reach and is
          attractive to those who want to reduce environmental impact and cost
          of living." -<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-grid"

        The off-grid community consists of individuals from various backgrounds
        and communities. Uninterested in societal norms, this vast group of
        innovators may be on to something as they rid themselves of a life
        filled with debt and reliance upon the government for their needs. Some
        might refer to this lifestyle as being one of the highest expressions of
        freedom.
